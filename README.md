# bitcoin-notify

Eventually, this application will become a notification system meant to execute
actions when transactions appear in the Bitcoin network. The specific first
action it will support is email, so you can get an email when someone sends you
bitcoins.

## Install

  git clone git://github.com/bitcoin-notify/bitcoin-notify.git
