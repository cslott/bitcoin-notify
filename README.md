This application requires Node.js and the bitcoinjs package.

Currently, this is just a placeholder for a real application. Eventually, it will contain a notification system meant to execute actions when transactions appear in the Bitcoin network. The specific first action it will support is email, so you can get an email when someone sends you bitcoins.
